# Intro

SDA allows us to configure domains to authenticate the app similar to Chrome using SSO / AD.

# Platforms Supported

macOS, Windows

# Purpose

To allow users to automatically login to the Symphony app using AD / SSO authentication protocols.

# Details

In the current implementation, we support this feature by setting flags to appropirate values in the Chromium container. The following flags are set:

```
auth-server-whitelist
auth-negotiate-delegate-whitelist
```

To make this work, you need to set the "authServerWhitelist" and "authNegotiateDelegateWhitelist" to the necessary SSO url under the "customFlags" configuration in the "Symphony.config" file.

# Examples

If your app is installed in `C:\Program Files\Symphony\Symphony`, you need to edit the file `Symphony.config` under the `config` sub-directory and set `authServerWhitelist` and `authNegotiateDelegateWhitelist` to `https://example.com/sso`.

# Other Info
We also set the `NTLMCredentialsForDomains` in the default session of the electron app as a fallback.
