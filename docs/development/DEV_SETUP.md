## Prerequisites

### Windows
- NodeJS version >= 12.x.y (corresponds to electron 9.x.y)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community or Paid (C++ and .NET/C# development tools)
- Python >= 2.7.1
- Dot Net 3.5 SP1
- [Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/)

#### Notes
- C++ tools are required to recompile node modules
- Dot NET/C# tools required to compile screen-snippet module
- Open 'Developer Command Prompt for VS2015'. This sets paths to visual studio build tools.
- The advanced installer is required to create msi installer

### Mac
- Xcode command line tools. Or better, Xcode latest version
- NodeJS version >= 12.x.y (corresponds to electron 9.x.y)
- [Sudre Packages](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html)

#### Notes
- Ensure you have accepted the XCode license agreement
- We use Sudre packages to create a .pkg installer file 

## Run demo:
- npm install
- npm run demo (runs platform specific commands)

*Note*: 
- Remember to set this.origin to '*' in `app-bridge.ts` when running the demo. 
- Search for `// DEMO-APP:` and comment that line back in. 
- Make sure to comment it out again before you commit.

## Build Instructions:

### Mac üñ•
- npm install
- npm run dev (to run locally)
- To build the macOS app:
  * Run the command `npm run unpacked-mac`
  * The distributable is created in the `dist/mac` directory
- To build mac package (installer):  
  * Run the command `npm run packed-mac`
  * The .pkg file will be generated in the `installer/mac/build` directory

### Windows üíª
- npm install
- npm run dev (to run locally)
- To build windows unpacked exe:
  * Run the command `npm run unpacked-win`
  * The distributable is created in the `dist/win-unpacked` directory
- To build windows 64-bit unpacked exe:
  * Run the command `npm run unpacked-win`
  * The distributable is created in the `dist/win-unpacked` directory
- To create msi (installer):
  * Run the advanced installer script located in `installer/win` directory
  
#### MSI command line options:
- To install for all users (admin required): msiexec.exe /i Symphony-x64.msi ALLUSERS=1
- To install per user: msiexec.exe /i Symphony-x64.msi ALLUSERS=""
- To change default pod url: msiexe.exe /i Symphony-x64.msi POD_URL=my.symphony.com
- To change auto start: msiexe.exe /i Symphony-x64.msi AUTO_LAUNCH=true (or false) - if not specified default it true.
- To change minimize on close: msiexe.exe /i Symphony-x64.msi MINIMIZE_ON_CLOSE=true (or false) - if not specified default is true.
- Any of the above options can be chained together, for example: msiexe.exe /i Symphony-x64.msi MINIMIZE_ON_CLOSE=true AUTO_START=false POD_URL=my.symphony.com
- The available values for various settings in the installer is listed below
  * POD_URL (String)
  * ALWAYS_ON_TOP (Boolean)
  * AUTO_LAUNCH (Boolean)
  * MINIMIZE_ON_CLOSE (Boolean)
  * BRING_TO_FRONT (Boolean)
  * MEDIA (Boolean)
  * LOCATION (Boolean)
  * NOTIFICATIONS (Boolean)
  * MIDI_SYSEX (Boolean)
  * FULL_SCREEN (Boolean)
  * POINTER_LOCK (Boolean)
  * OPEN_EXTERNAL (Boolean)

### Linux üê≥
- Download and install Docker daemon [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Run the below docker commands under the project directory
- To generate and tag the container
`docker build -t linux:6.0.0 --build-arg REPO=https://github.com/symphonyoss/SymphonyElectron --build-arg BRANCH=linux .`
- To make sure the image is created and tagged correctly
`docker images`
- To run the docker image and generate the linux builds üéâ
`docker run --name linux linux:6.0.0`
- To copy the builds
`docker cp linux:/SymphonyElectron/dist/symphony-6.1.0.x86_64.rpm ~/Desktop`
`docker cp linux:/SymphonyElectron/dist/symphony_6.1.0_amd64.deb ~/Desktop`

##### Other useful docker commands
- To connect to the interactive bash
`docker run -i -t linux:6.0.0 /bin/bash`
- To delete all stopper containers
`docker system prune -a`
- To delete the container/image
`docker rmi -f linux:6.0.0`

## Change POD URL
- To change the start url (i.e., pod url), edit config/Symphony.config and change 'url' variable. if no protocol provided, then https will be added.
- The installer will include file config/Symphony.config next to executable. Changes in this file will affect all
 users.
- Alternatively, to run against a specific pod, launch Symphony (SDA) with the command line parameter `--url=pod_url
`. With this, you don't have to change the config/Symphony.config file every time.

## Tests
- Use `npm test` to run all the tests

### Unit tests and Code Coverage
- [Jest framework](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) is used to run tests
- Use `npm run test:unit` to run unit tests
- We capture the Code coverage reports under [coverage](out/coverage)
- To check the test run report, see the [out](out/) directory
- See the [tests](spec/) directory to find all the unit tests

### Spectron Tests (UI)
- [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) is used to run Spectron tests
- Use `npm run test:spectron` to run spectron tests
- To compile spectron tests `npm run compile:spec`
- To run specific test use example: `npm run test:spectron -- --match=spell*` runs only spellchecker related tests
- Spectron - Application logs can be found in `~/Library/Logs/Electron/`  

## Logging
- We enable local logging for dev environments using the module [electron-log](https://www.npmjs.com/package
/electron-log)
- On macOS, we store the logs under `~/Library/Logs/Electron/app_<timestamp>.log`
- On Windows, we store the logs under `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Electron\app_<timestamp>.log`
- On Linux, we store the logs under `~/.config/Electron/logs/app_<timestamp>.log`

## Misc notes
- If you need to run against a POD without proper cert use cmd line option: --ignore-certificate-errors
- To start an additional instance with custom data directory (if you want seperate user) use cmd line options
: --multiInstance --userDataPath=`<path to data dir>`
- If directory doesn't exist, it will be created
